# SAP HANA Spatial Resources
This page gathers a couple of resources around SAP HANA Spatial. For the high-level overview visit the landing page for [Spatial Solutions from SAP](https://www.sap.com/cmp/oth/crm-ya19-pdm-ddmpmwbss/index.html). The easiest way to get started with Spatial Processing in SAP HANA is to get a [free trial instance of SAP HANA Cloud](https://saphanajourney.com/free-trial/).
